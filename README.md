# Classification-of-film-reviews-into-positive-and-negative

Given a set of movie reviews, your task is to automatically determine which of the reviews are positive and which are negative. Two files train.csv and test.csv are given as input data. For a training set (train.csv) you have been given the texts of the reviews, the markup and the ID of the film to which the review refers are known. For the test suite (test.csv) you only know the text of the review. It is required to determine whether it is positive or negative.

The sample_submission.csv file contains an example file to send to the server. It contains two fields review_id and positive. You should output a binary value (0 or 1) in the positive field, depending on whether the positive review is (1) or negative (0). Important: in this problem, we output not a probability, but a ready-made answer, that is, only the values 0 or 1 are accepted.
